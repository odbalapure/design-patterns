        // Adding a NEW strategy is easy:
        // 1. Create a new class implementing ShippingStrategy (e.g.,
        // FreeShippingStrategy)
        // 2. Client can then instantiate and use it:
        // ShippingStrategy freeShipping = new FreeShippingStrategy();
        // shippingService.setStrategy(freeShipping);
        // shippingService.calculateShippingCost(primeMemberOrder);
        // No modification to ShippingCostService is needed!
